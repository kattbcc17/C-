# C-
Practice
# Overview

In this section, I aim to showcase my journey as a software developer student practicing C++ for the first time, focusing on my commitment to continuous learning and growth. The software I've developed serves as a testament to my dedication to mastering the C++ language and furthering my understanding of its syntax and capabilities.

The software I've written is a simple calculator application. It serves as a practical demonstration of various C++ language features, including basic arithmetic operations.

My purpose in developing this software is to deepen my understanding of the C++ language by applying its concepts in a real-world project. Secondly, I seek to hone my problem-solving skills and software development abilities through hands-on experience.

The provided video offers a walkthrough of the software in action, highlighting key functionalities and explaining the underlying code. Through this demonstration, I aim to share insights into my learning process and showcase the practical application of C++ syntax.

# Development Environment

I used [ yet to describe tools, IDEs, or environments] to develop the software. Additionally, the project was implemented using the C++ programming language.

# Useful Websites

During the development process, I found the following websites to be particularly helpful:

- [Web Site Name](https://www.youtube.com/@yacklyon5993)
- [Web Site Name](https://www.w3schools.com/cpp/)

These resources provided valuable insights, tutorials, and documentation that aided me in understanding and implementing various aspects of the C++ language.

# Future Work

While the current version of the software demonstrates my proficiency in C++, there are several areas I plan to address in future iterations:

- Implement feature X to enhance functionality.
- Optimize code for improved performance.
Enhance user interface for better usability.
- By addressing these points, I aim to continuously refine and improve the software, thereby advancing my skills as a software developer.
